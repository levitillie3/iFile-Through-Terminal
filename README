	As I said in the description, this is a simple script to open iFile through the terminal on your iDevice. It works on all Jailbroken devices with terminal or SSH installed. To build simply download the git repository, any way you'd like, and modify the script to your liking(optional). Next cd into the downloaded/unpacked directory and type:

		make

	There are no other requirements other than installing the deb to your device.
	You can also install this package via my repo on cydia:

	COMING CHANGES:

		Make a better-detailed README
